# MudBot

2016-02-22

This is the repo for the currently brand new and 
completely non-functional MajorMUD scripting and 
automation tool with the working name of "MudBot"


The current ToDo list, for the short term, is:
- [ ] Get a skeleton project imported
- [ ] Determine how the project will be structured
- [ ] Start stubbing out classes, structure
- [ ] Figure out who is going to be involved and where their skillsets match up best
